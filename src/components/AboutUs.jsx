            <p className="about-text">
              Founded in 2024, Candidate emerged from a simple yet powerful observation: technical interviews are broken. 
              Too often, brilliant engineers are overlooked due to interview anxiety, while companies struggle to 
              identify true technical talent through outdated assessment methods.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
              Our founding team combines decades of experience in software engineering, technical recruitment, 
              and human-computer interaction. We've sat on both sides of the interview table ‚Äì as candidates 
              facing nerve-wracking technical challenges and as interviewers trying to make fair, accurate assessments.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
              We believe that great engineering talent deserves a fair chance to shine, and that companies deserve 
              better tools to identify the right candidates. That's why we're building Candidate ‚Äì to create a more 
              equitable, insightful, and collaborative approach to technical interviews.
